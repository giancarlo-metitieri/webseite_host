          <h2>General Information</h2>
          <div>
            Sony’s intelligent industry-leading noise canceling headphones with premium sound elevate your listening
            experience with the ability to personalize and control everything you hear.<br><br>

            Industry-leading noise cancellation technology means you hear every word, note, and tune with incredible
            clarity, no matter your environment. These noise canceling headphones feature additional microphones that
            assist in isolating sound for a reduction of even more high and mid frequency sounds.<br><br>

            Dual noise sensor technology, featuring two microphones on each earcup, captures ambient noise and passes
            the data to the HD Noise-Canceling Processor QN1. Using a new algorithm, the HD Noise-Canceling Processor
            QN1 then applies noise-canceling processing in real time to a range of acoustic environments. Working
            together with a new Bluetooth® Audio SoC (System on Chip), it senses and adjusts to music and noise signals,
            as well as acoustic characteristics between the driver unit and ears, at over 700 times per second.<br><br>

            To maximize noise-canceling performance, the WH-1000XM4 headphones incorporate two technologies: Personal
            Noise-Canceling Optimizer, designed specifically for you, and Atmospheric Pressure Optimizing, designed
            specifically for air travel.<br><br>

            Adjust ambient sound with the Sony Headphones Connect app to cancel noise while still allowing essential
            sounds, like overhead announcements, through when you're listening on the move.<br><br>

            LDAC transmits approximately three times more data (at the maximum transfer rate of 990 kbps) than
            conventional BLUETOOTH® audio, allowing you to enjoy High-Resolution Audio content in exceptional quality,
            as close as possible to that of a dedicated wired connection.<br><br>

            A built-in analog amplifier integrated in the HD Noise-Canceling Processor QN1 realizes an unmatched
            signal-to-noise ratio for low distortion and exceptional sound quality for portable devices. Powerful 1.57"
            drivers, with Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP) diaphragms, make the headphones perfect for handling heavy beats
            and can reproduce a full range of frequencies up to 40 kHz.<br><br>

            Using Edge-AI (Artificial Intelligence) co-developed with Sony Music Studios Tokyo, DSEE Extreme™ (Digital
            Sound Enhancement Engine) upscales compressed digital music files in real time. Dynamically recognizing
            instrumentation, musical genres, and individual elements of each song, such as vocals or interludes, it
            restores the high-range sound lost in compression for a richer, more complete listening experience.<br><br>

            The WH-1000XM4 headphones use an array of smart technologies to create a seamless, hands-free listening
            experience. For example, simply start speaking to automatically pause your music in Speak-to-Chat, or enjoy
            adaptive playback thanks to the proximity sensor and two acceleration sensors that detect whether your
            headphones are being worn or not.<br><br>

            As soon as you speak to someone, Speak-to-Chat automatically stops the music and lets in ambient sound so
            you can conduct a conversation—handy if you want to keep your headphones on, or your hands are full. Based
            on Precise Voice Pickup Technology, this smart feature uses five microphones built into your headphones and
            advanced audio signal processing to recognize and react to your voice. And once your chat is over, your
            music starts playing again automatically.<br><br>

            Over time, Adaptive Sound Control learns to recognize locations that you frequently visit, such as your
            workplace, the gym, or a favorite café, and tailors sound to suit the situation.<br><br>
