          <h2>General Information</h2>
          <div>
            Bose Headphones 700 feature Bose's renowned noise cancelling, astonishing sound, and unrivaled voice pickup.
            They’re smart headphones you’ll come to love whenever you want to listen to music, get work done, or just
            shut out the world for a few moments and relax. And now they’re bundled with the Headphones 700 Charging
            Case, making them an even smarter — and more convenient — choice. <br><br>

            The patented active noise cancelling technology in Bose Headphones 700 uses microphones both inside and
            outside the earcups to monitor the sounds around you and instantly produce an opposite signal to cancel them
            out,
            creating an empty stage for your music to play on. At the same time, Bose's proprietary TriPort acoustic
            headphone structure uses external ports to vent the earcups and maximize the acoustic space inside, giving
            your music the depth and detail the artist intended for you to hear.<br><br>

            Bose Headphones 700 offer you an unsurpassed level of control, with 11 noise cancelling settings you can
            adjust
            with the Bose Music app or directly on the headphones via designated preset levels. Choose from full noise
            cancelling (which helps isolate you from your surroundings) to full transparency (which helps let in your
            surroundings, as if you weren’t wearing headphones at all). And for those moments when you’re ordering
            coffee or listening for your gate number, one click triggers Conversation Mode. It simultaneously pauses
            your music and switches your headphones to full transparency so you can listen and converse as
            needed.<br><br>


            Background noise always seems to be at its worst when you’re on a call. Passing cars, the bustle of the
            office, or the kids having a spirited “discussion.” Bose Headphones 700 feature a revolutionary microphone
            system
            with game-changing voice pickup that adapts to your surroundings in real time. Bose engineered six mics to
            work together to cancel the noise around you so you can hear the caller better. At the same time, four mics
            combine to improve the clarity of your voice so the caller can hear you better, first by isolating your
            speech and then by suppressing the most disruptive remaining sound around you. It’s unlike anything
            available in other headphones.<br><br>

            When it comes to noise cancelling headphones, Bose has a decades-long legacy. But Bose started fresh for
            Bose Headphones 700. The result? A new, head-turning form factor, designed for all-day, everyday use. They
            better
            fit the anatomy of the human head, thanks to earcups tilted at 15 degrees. And a streamlined steel headband
            is tuned with just enough clamping force to remain comfortable. The ear cushions are made from plush protein
            leather, perfect for long listening sessions. They look great. And feel even better.<br><br>

            Bose worked hard to make Bose Headphones 700 easy to use. The right earcup features capacitive touch
            sensors, so
            you can manage volume, calls, and music without reaching for your phone. Low-profile buttons control the
            power, noise cancelling presets, and voice assistant (VPA) access. Built-in voice control provides instant
            access to your music, messages, and information. And the Bose Music app lets you access selectable EQ,
            manage your Bluetooth connections, change your VPA, check your battery life, and more.<br><br>

            Want to watch TV but not disturb anyone else? With Bose SimpleSync™ technology, you can pair your Bose Noise
            Cancelling Headphones 700 with a Bose Soundbar 500 or Smart Soundbar 700 for a personal TV listening
            experience. Independent volume controls allow you to lower or mute your soundbar while keeping your
            headphones as loud as you like.<br><br>

            On their own, Headphones 700 provide up to 20 hours of play time. But with the Headphones 700 Charging Case
            you’ll never have to worry about a dead battery. Even after a long day of meetings and calls, your
            headphones will be ready to go when you cue up your wind down playlist. The case protects your headphones
            and provides up to two full charges, so you can enjoy up to 40 additional hours of listening time.
